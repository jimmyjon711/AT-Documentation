# Armored Turtle Documentation
Welcome to the consolidated documentation site for Armored Turtle projects! This site is a work in progress and will 
be updated as we continue to develop and improve our projects.

Along with our guided assembly manuals available [here](https://www.armoredturtle.xyz), we also have a wealth of 
information available on this site to help you get started with your Armored Turtle projects.

!!!note "Initial Startup Guide"
    This documentation site is intended to be used in conjunction with the [Armored Turtle Assembly Manuals](https://www.armoredturtle.xyz).
    The assembly manuals provide detailed instructions for assembling your Armored Turtle projects, while this site provides 
    additional information and resources to help you get the most out of your projects.
    
    If you have not yet assembled your Armored Turtle project, please refer to the assembly manuals first.

Generally speaking, most ==BoxTurtle== users will want to start with the [Initial Startup Guide](boxturtle/initial_startup/01-overview.md)
once the physical assembly is complete. You may have to refer to the [AFC-Klipper Add-On](afc-klipper-add-on/index.md) 
for additional configuration information, or additional tuning instructions.

This website is organization into multiple sections, each with its own focus. The main sections are:

- [AFC-Klipper Add-On](afc-klipper-add-on/index.md): This section contains information about the AFC-Klipper add-on; 
  including installation 
  instructions, configuration options, examples, and more.

- [BoxTurtle](boxturtle/index.md): This section contains information about the BoxTurtle, including a quick start 
  guide, configuration 
  options, slicer configuration and more.

- [AFC-Accessories](afc-accessories/index.md): This section contains information about the AFC-Accessories, including 
  installation instructions, configuration 
  options, and troubleshooting tips.

- [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting/troubleshooting.md): This section contains information about common issues and 
  how to resolve them across all the 
  various projects.
