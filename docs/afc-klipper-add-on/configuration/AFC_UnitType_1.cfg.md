# AFC_UnitType_1.cfg Configuration Overview

The `AFC_UnitType_1.cfg` file is used to define the configuration for the AFC system when using a specific unit type.

This file will typically be named in the format of `AFC_Turtle_1.cfg` for example, when a BoxTurtle is installed. If 
multiple unit types are installed, the file will be named in the format of `AFC_Turtle_2.cfg`, `AFC_Turtle_3.cfg`, etc.

!!! note

    The actual naming convention may vary depending on your specific setup. The unit name can be renamed by using the 
    `install-afc.sh` script.

## [mcu mcu_name] Section

This section will define the MCU used for the specific unit.

!!! warning

    Either `canbus_uuid` or `serial` should be defined, not both. Please ensure that you are using the correct
    configuration for your setup. The `canbus_uuid` is used for CAN bus devices, while the `serial` is used for
    USB devices. Whichever option is **NOT** being used should be commented out.

``` cfg
[include mcu/<mcu_name>.cfg]
#    This will be used for any MCU aliases or definition files.
[mcu mcu_name]
canbus_uuid: 1234567890a
#    UUID of the CAN bus device. This is used to identify the device 
#    on the CAN bus.
serial: /dev/serial/by-id/<device-name>
#    Serial address of the device. This is usually in the format of
#    `/dev/serial/by-id/<device-name>` 
```

## [temperature_sensor sensor_name] Section

If your MCU has a temperature sensor built in, you can define it here. 

``` cfg
[temperature_sensor sensor_name]
sensor_type: temperature_mcu
#    Type of temperature sensor. This is usually `temperature_mcu`
sensor_mcu: mcu_name
#    Name of the MCU that the temperature sensor is connected to.
```

## [AFC_lane lane_name] Section

The following options are available in the `[AFC_lane <lane_name>]` section of the `AFC_UnitType_1.cfg` file. These
options control the configuration of the AFC system when interfacing with the stepper motor for the specific unit type.
You will typically have one of these sections for each lane in the unit.  

Currently, AFC_lane sections are only valid for HTLF unit.

``` cfg
[AFC_lane <lane_name>]

unit: MCU:<lane>
#    This is the unit name of the stepper motor. This would typically be 
#    formatted as `MCU:<lane>` where `<lane>` is the lane number. The
#    MCU being being referenced is relative to the `[mcu <mcu_name>]`
#    in this file. For example: `unit: Turtle_1:1` would set this as
#    the first lane for the hardware connected to the `Turtle_1` MCU.
step_pin: mcu:pin
#    Step GPIO pin (triggered high). This parameter must be provided.
dir_pin: mcu:pin
#    Direction GPIO pin (high indicates positive direction). This
#    parameter must be provided.
enable_pin: mcu:pin
#    Enable pin (default is enable high; use ! to indicate enable
#    low). If this parameter is not provided then the stepper motor
#    driver must always be enabled.

#    parameter must be provided.
rotation_distance: 4.65
#    Default: 4.65
#    Distance (in mm) that the axis travels with one full rotation of
#    the stepper motor (or final gear if gear_ratio is specified).
#    This parameter must be provided. With a standard BoxTurtle based
#    on BOM components, this parameter should not need to be adjusted.
gear_ratio:
#    Default: <none>
#    For a standard BoxTurtle, this parameter should not need to be
#    set. This parameter is only used if a different gear set it used.
#    The gear ratio if the stepper motor is connected to the axis via a
#    gearbox. For example, one may specify "5:1" if a 5 to 1 gearbox is
#    in use. If the axis has multiple gearboxes one may specify a comma
#    separated list of gear ratios (for example, "57:11, 2:1"). If a
#    gear_ratio is specified then rotation_distance specifies the
#    distance the axis travels for one full rotation of the final gear.
#    The default is to not use a gear ratio.

## [AFC_stepper lane_name] Section

The following options are available in the `[AFC_stepper <lane_name>]` section of the `AFC_UnitType_1.cfg` file. These
options control the configuration of the AFC system when interfacing with the stepper motor for the specific unit type.
You will typically have one of these sections for each lane in the unit.

AFC_stepper inherits configuration options from AFC_lane configuration section, below are additional configuration values
for the AFC_stepper sections.  

``` cfg

[AFC_stepper <lane_name>]

print_current: 0.6
#    Default: 0.6
#    Current to use while printing, set to a lower current to reduce stepper 
#    heat when printing. Defaults to global_print_current, if not specified 
#    current is not changed.
```


## [tmc2209 AFC_stepper <lane_name>] Section

The following options are available in the `[tmc2209 AFC_stepper <lane_name>]` section of the `AFC_UnitType_1.cfg` file. These
options control the configuration of the AFC system when interfacing with the TMC2209 stepper motor driver for the specific unit type.

!!!note

    There should be a matching `[tmc2209 AFC_stepper <lane_name>]` section for each `[AFC_stepper <lane_name>]` 
    section in the configuration file.

``` cfg
[tmc2209 AFC_stepper <lane_name>]
uart_pin: mcu:pin
#    Example: Turtle_1:M1_UART
#    The UART pin for the TMC2209 stepper motor driver. 
uart_address: 0
#    Address of the TMC2209 driver on the UART bus.
run_current: 0.8
#    The amount of current (in amps RMS) to configure the driver to use
#    during stepper movement. This parameter must be provided.
sense_resistor: 0.110
#    The resistance (in ohms) of the driver sense resistor. This parameter
#    must be provided. Common values are 0.110 ohms for most TMC2209 drivers
#    and 0.075 ohms for TMC5160 drivers. Check your stepper driver documentation
#    or board schematic to confirm the correct value.
```
!!!warning

    Ensure that the `sense_resistor` is set appropriately. Failure to set this appropriately may result in
    overheating of the stepper motor driver and/or stepper motor. This value is typically set to 0.110 for the TMC2209
    stepper motor driver present on the AFC-Lite board for the BoxTurtle. You *MUST* change this based on your
    board if using another system / configuration.

## [AFC_hub hub_name] Section

The following options are available in the `[AFC_hub hub_name]` section of the `AFC_UnitType_1.cfg` file. These

#    and the cutting mechanism can be engaged. This is only required
#    when `cut: True` is set.

#    proper color order is set. An incorrect value may result in 
#    sporadic behavior of the LEDs.
```

## [AFC_button lane_name] Section

The following options are available in the `[AFC_button lane_name]` section of the `AFC_UnitType_1.cfg` file. These

``` cfg
[AFC_button lane1]
pin: 
#    Default: <none>
#    The pin that the switch is connected for the specified lane.

#    Default: False
#    When True, AFC will unload lane and then pause when runout is 
#    triggered and spool to swap is not set (infinite spool). Setting

## [AFC_NightOwl unit_name] Section

The following options are available in the `[AFC_NightOwl unit_name]` section of the `AFC_UnitType_1.cfg` file. These
options control the configuration of the AFC system when interfacing with the NightOwl unit type. This section is
typically used to define the unit name and other options that are specific to the NightOwl unit type.
 

AFC_NightOwl inherits configuration options from AFC_BoxTurtle configuration section, below are additional configuration values
for a NightOwl unit.  

``` cfg
[AFC_NightOwl NightOwl_1]

enable_sensors_in_gui: True
#    Default: True
#    Set to True to show prep and load sensors switches as filament sensors 
#    in Mainsail/Fluidd gui, overrides value set in AFC.cfg.
```

## [servo tool_cut] Section

The following options are available for all units (BoxTurtle, HTLF, and NightOwl) and allow for the configuration and 
operation of a gantry mounted servo to assist in tool cutting. 

``` cfg
[servo tool_cut]
#--=================================================================================--#
######### Tip Cut Servo ###############################################################
#--=================================================================================--#
pin: YOUR_SERVO_PIN_HERE
#    This should be the MCU/pin combination for the servo pin.
minimum_pulse_width: 0.00053
#    Adjust this value until a '_CUTTER_SERVO POS=out' extends the pin 
#    fully without a buzzing sound.
maximum_pulse_width: 0.0023
#    Adjust this value until a '_CUTTER_SERVO POS=in' retracts the pin 
#    fully without a buzzing sound.
maximum_servo_angle: 180
#   Initial angle (in degrees) to set the servo to. The default is to
#   not send any signal at startup.
